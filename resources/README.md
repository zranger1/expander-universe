## ExpanderVerse ##

** WORK IN PROGRESS - COMING SOON! **

ExpanderVerse lets you drive addressable LEDs with your computer, a USB->Serial adapter, and a Pixelblaze Output Expander board.  Potentially *many* LEDs. 

Each Pixelblaze Output Expander board (PBX) supports up to 8 output channels with up to 800 LEDs each.

You can chain up to 8 PBX boards on a single USB->serial port, and ExpanderVerse supports multiple serial ports. Your computer's USB output bandwidth and your ability to supply power to all those LEDs are the largest limiting factors.

You can drive both WS2812 and APA102 type LED, and it is possible to mix types on a single PBX board.

#### Why use this and not Pixelblaze?   
I'm a big fan of Pixelblaze. It's generally the fastest way to get to the fun, creative part of an LED project. Most of the time, for most projects, Pixelblaze is more convenient in many ways. However there are some occasions:

- You want to smoothly animate an installation with several thousand LEDs
- You want a hardwired interface rather than depending on WiFi
- You want a central point of control rather than distributing several microcontrollers
- You need to control or sync with other devices or media which run on, or communicate via
computer.
